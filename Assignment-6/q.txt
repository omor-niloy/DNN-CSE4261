By the help of Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, investigate which area of an adversarial example of an image makes your favorite neural network confused. 

Compare most important area of an adversarial example with the important area of the original image.

Investigate what will happen if you consider softmax layer for Grad-CAM and the previous-layer of the softmax layer for IG for estimating gradients.
